Studies investigating the use of BCIs have primarily focused on surface electrodes;however, subcortically implanted microchips may provide novel, non-pharmacological approachesfor managing nervous system disorders. Accessing subcortical regions without disrupting sur-rounding tissues remains a significant challenge. Accordingly, we conducted an observational,proof-of-concept study to evaluate the use of a modified BrainPath® device to implant subcorticalmicrochips in a rodent model. All animals survived the procedure and lived with a microchip in situfor one or three months with no apparent neurological effects. Histological examination revealedthat implantation of a small chip was associated with some tissue damage, tract formation, andsurrounding reactive changes. Gliosis and hemosiderin-laden macrophages were evident sur-rounding tract marks after one month and focal cystic cavitation consistent with infarcted tissuewas evident after three months. While a more extensive cellular proliferation response wasapparent one month after implantation of a large microchip, there was no significant collagendeposition suggestive of fibrosis. This study is the first demonstration of subcortical microchipimplantation using a novel neurosurgical technique that may facilitate the development of BCItechnologies for treatment of neurological disorders.ARTICLE HISTORYReceived 1 December 2022Accepted 9 August 2023KEYWORDSBrain-computer-interfaces;neurosurgery; electrodes,implanted; brain; nervoussystem; animals1. IntroductionDespite its resemblance to science fiction, the use ofbrain–computer interface (BCI) technologies that linkthe brain and computers through electrode implanta-tion in the scalp, subdural, or subcortical brain regions[1] is a rapidly developing area of interest in medicine.BCIs may provide novel non-pharmacological optionsfor managing a wide range of complex neurologicalconditions, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,Parkinson’s disease, minimally conscious states [2],spinal cord injury and paralysis [2,3], stroke [2,4], neu-rofibromatosis [5], and locked-in syndrome [6,7].Studies investigating the use of BCIs in nervous sys-tem disorders have primarily focused on brain-surfaceelectrodes, which are minimally invasive but offer lowfidelity spatial and temporal signal resolution [1,8,9]. Incontrast, subcortically placed integrated circuits (ICs),or microchips, may provide more sensitive and accuratedata but require more invasive neurosurgical implanta-tion techniques [10]. Accessing subcortical regionswithout disrupting surrounding brain tissue remainsa major challenge to the use of implanted BCIs. Inaddition, implantation of devices within the brain mayresult in an adverse tissue response to injury and foreignmaterials – the foreign body response [10] – character-ized by activated microglia, reactive astrocytes, and theformation of a fibrous envelope, or glial scar, surround-ing injured tissue [11,12]. Understanding the responseof surrounding tissue to the implantation of BCI devices[13] is fundamental for further development of micro-chips as tools to help manage disease.Several methods to facilitate the placement of BCIswithin the central nervous system already exist [14];however, a minimally invasive neurosurgical approach –the NICO BrainPath® device (NICO Corporation,Indianapolis, Indiana, USA) – may provide a novelmethod for subcortical BCI implantation. TheBrainPath is a tubular retraction system that usesa transsulcal approach to exploit naturally existing ana-tomical corridors using intraoperative navigation. Usinga parafascicular, fiber-sparing approach, the device isinserted in parallel to white matter tracts, displacingrather than dissecting or transecting tissue or fibertracts, thereby minimizing tissue disruption [15,16].CONTACT Julian E.

Re-purposing an existing neuro-surgical tool may provide a novel and cost-effectivemeans of circumventing current limitations on subcor-tical IC placement. This study is the first description ofa technique that may provide access to deep brainregions for implantation of BCIs.The objectives of this proof-of-concept, observationalstudy were to (i) determine if a modified BrainPath devicecould be used to implant a microchip into the parenchymaof the rat brain without affecting animal survival, (ii)determine whether the implanted microchip wouldremain in place without severe neurological effects in theanimal (e.g. stroke or paralysis), and (iii) evaluate the localeffects of the implanted microchip on brain tissue, usinghistological and immunohistochemical staining, after themicrochip remained in situ for one or three months.2. Materials and methodsAll studies were performed within the National Instituteof Health guidelines and approved by the InstitutionalAnimal Care and Use Committee at NorthShoreUniversity HealthSystem Research Institute inEvanston, Illinois, USA.2.1. MicrochipsMicrochips were obtained from the Rogers ResearchGroup at Northwestern University, Evanston Illinois,USA [18]. Microchips were fabricated by applying silverelectrode paste onto a high-purity ceramic substrate,followed by dry firing to form inner electrical termina-tions. The circuitry consisted of a metal oxide film,encapsulated by a coating of epoxy resin to protect themicrochip from mechanical damage and moisture orother contaminants. Microchip contact leads werea nickel-tin alloy. All microchips were passive, i.e. hadno internal function and were not connected to anexternal source. Microchips were produced in twosizes for this study: the small chip measured 1 mm ×0.5 mm × 0.mm (L × W × H) (Figure 1a,c): the largechip measured 2.0 mm × 1.25 mm × 0.6 mm (L × W ×H) (Figure 1b,c). Although these microchips had notpreviously been used in rodent brain, similar micro-chips and constituent materials have been used in ani-mal and non-animal studies [19–21].2.2. Implantation devicesModified BrainPath devices were custom-made by NICOCorporation to fit the microchips. Like the full-scaleBrainPath, the modified BrainPath devices were designedto penetrate the brain cortical surface, causing minimaldisruption and damage to the surrounding tissue whilefacilitating easy access to subcortical regions. Deviceswere made from a biocompatible polymer and comprisedan obturator and sheath. The obturator probe was placedinside the sheath such that the tip protruded 0.5 mm fromthe end of the sheath. Once the device was in place, theobturator could be removed to allow microchip implan-tation into subcortical regions through the sheath. Toreduce friction between the obturator and inner sheath,the inner sheath was lubricated with a docosahexaenoicacid-based oil (Manchester Consolidated Corporation,Toronto, Canada).Two different sizes of modified BrainPath deviceswere produced. The 19-gauge device (Figure 2a) con-sisted of a 71.2 mm long obturator with a 45.8 mm longprobe with a diameter of 0.8 mm. The length of thesheath component was 47.9 mm, and an outer sheathFigure 1.

The 15-gauge device (Figure 2b) consisted ofa 73.3 mm long obturator with a 47.9 mm long probewith a diameter of 1.6 mm. The length of the sheathcomponent was 47.9 mm, with an outer diameter of 1.8mm to ensure a tight fit around the large microchip.2.3. Animal careMale Sprague-Daley rats were sourced from Charles RiverLaboratories (Kingston, New York, USA and Raleigh,North Carolina, USA). Animals were housed in pairs ina controlled temperature environment under a 12-h light/dark cycle, with access to chow and water ad libitum. Allanimals were provided at least 72 h to acclimate followingarrival at the facility, with periodic cage changes, beforesurgery. Animals were aged 18–23 weeks and weighedbetween 440 g and 650 g at the time of surgery.2.4. Study groupsAnimals were randomly assigned to three study groups,which differed based on microchip size and length ofimplantation, as follows: small chip (1.0 × 0.5 × 0.3 mm)implanted for one month (n = 6); small chip implantedfor three months (n = 5); and large chip (2.0 × 1.25 × 0.6mm) implanted for one month (n = 6). An additionalplanned study group – large chip implanted for threemonths – was not completed due to COVID-19 pan-demic restrictions.2.5. Sterilisation of surgical equipment andmicrochipsThe materials used to manufacture the microchips andmodified BrainPath devices required low-temperaturesterilization. Sterrad processing technology (AdvancedSterilization Products) was used to sterilize microchipsand BrainPath devices at 40–55°C (104–131°F) for 55min. All other surgical equipment was sterilized usingan autoclave for 30 min at 121°C (250°F).2.6. Surgical microchip implantation procedureAnimals were weighed and anesthetized with 4% iso-flurane (2 L/min of O2) for 5 min through an inductionchamber. They were then transferred to a cone-shapedanesthesia mask (Kopf Instruments) and 2% isoflurane(2 L/min O2) was delivered as maintenance anesthesiathroughout the preparation and surgery. The scalp wasshaved between the eyes and ears and a lubricating gelwas applied to the eyes before the animal was trans-ferred to a stereotactic frame (Kopf Instruments) andsecured in place with ear and bite bars. The surgical sitewas then cleansed three times with a cotton tip applica-tion of ethanol followed by betadine. Press’n Seal (GladProducts Co.) was used as a drape to cover the animal’sbody with only the surgical area exposed [22] to main-tain body temperature.Once the absence of pain reflexes was verified, a 1.5cm midline incision was made near the bregma (usingthe eyes and ears as the anterior and posterior bound-aries). Next, the periostium was undermined andretracted to expose bregma and lambda on the calvarialsurface. The BrainPath device was clamped intoa universal stereotactic holder (Model 1772, KopfInstruments) and leveled with the bregma-midlineintersection on the skull. This landmark was used asa standardized reference point to determine the coor-dinates for placing bilateral burr holes in each animal.Anterior-posterior (AP), medial-lateral (ML), and dor-sal-ventral (DV) coordinates were recorded using thisreference point on the skull of each animal. Next, thecoordinates of the posterior region of the subcorticalsupplementary motor cortex (M2) were calculated. APcoordinates remained unchanged as the position didnot deviate from bregma. ML coordinates deviated by±0.35 mm relative to bregma, and DV coordinatesdeviated by −0.8 mm.A Dremel drill with a 2 mm bit was used to makebilateral burr holes through the calvarium to the duraat the coordinates detailed above (Figure 3). TheBrainPath device was then inserted into the parench-yma of one hemisphere under stereotactic control. Theobturator was removed from the sheath and the micro-chip was inserted into the proximal end. The obturatorwas placed back into the sheath to ensure that the chipwas pushed through the sheath and into the cortex.Following microchip implantation, the universalstereotactic holder was slowly raised to lift theBrainPath device from the parenchyma. Surgical-grade sterile bone wax was then applied to the openingof the burr hole to prevent dislodging the microchipfrom the subcortical region. This procedure was thenrepeated on the contralateral hemisphere withoutmicrochip insertion, as a control. The experimentaland control hemisphere sides were alternated for eachnext animal.At the end of the procedure, the surgical site wascleaned with ethanol and betadine before skin edgeswere closed using 9 mm stainless steel autoclips(Braintree Scientific). Vetbond glue (3 M) was appliedto the wound to ensure the autoclips remained inplace. Topical antibiotic ointment was applied to pre-vent infection and 4 mg/kg of 1% lidocaine and 2 mg/kg meloxicam were injected subcutaneously at theBRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACES 3incision site. A subcutaneous 4 ml saline bolus wasthen administered under the scruff to prevent dehy-dration. Isoflurane administration was stopped, andthe animals were removed from the bite and ear barsand placed in a warmed recovery cage for close mon-itoring as the effects of anesthesia dissipated. Theanimals were later returned to their home cages.2.7. Post-surgical evaluationFollowing surgery, all animals received additional suppor-tive care in the form of water and wet food (moistenedchow and peanut butter) as well as nutritional paste,Nutra-gel (Bio-Serv), and Napa Nectar (SE Lab GroupInc.) on the cage floor to ensure access to food and waterdespite any physical limitations. Subcutaneous meloxicam(1 mg/kg) was administered daily for the first two-daypost-surgery. The welfare of animals was assessed on day1 following implantation surgery and on the last day beforeeuthanasia. A clinical record (CR) score for each day wasobtained based on the following indicators: weight loss,dull/ruffled coat, porphyrin staining (stress marks),hunched posture, apathy/decreased activity, paresis, andparalysis. The presence or absence of these indicators wasmarked as either 0 (absent) or 1 (present). Scores weretotaled to obtain the clinical record (CR) score.Figure 2.

Histological and immunohistochemicalanalysis of brain tissueAt the study endpoint (either one month or three months),the animals underwent anesthesia with 5% isoflurane (2 L/min of O2) for 5 min. Upon the absence of pain reflexes,animals were humanely euthanized via transcardial perfu-sion with 10% formalin. Fixed carcasses were rested for atleast 1 h before brains were extracted and placed in 10%formalin to continue emersion fixation. As the tracts madeby the BrainPath device remained visible on the corticalsurface at both study endpoints (Figure 4a), fixed brainswere sectioned coronally on either side of the visible tractmarks. These regions were then processed and embeddedin paraffin wax (Figure 4b). 4 µm serial sections wereobtained, and tissue was stained with Mayer’sHaematoxylin & Eosin (H&E) and trichrome. All immu-noperoxidase stains were done on Ventena BenchmarkUltra with a 3,3′-Diaminobenzidine (DAB) detection sys-tem using antibodies against CD68 (Abcam ab125212),glial fibrillary acid protein GFAP (Ventana EP672X)) andCD3 (Ventana 2GV6).3.

Both of these indicators persisted beyondthe first day. Motor impairments, such as paresis orparalysis, were not observed in any animal followingthe surgical procedure despite implantation of themicrochips in a motor cortex region. At the end of thestudy, all animals had a CR score of 0 indicative of noneurological deficits. All animals had exceeded theirpre-surgical weight by the study endpoint.3.3. Histological analysisH&E staining of brain tissue one month afterimplantation with the small microchip (Figure 5b,c) showed evidence of a tract formation with sur-rounding gliosis and hemosiderin-laden macro-phages. In addition, parts of the implantedmicrochip were seen at the base of the tract(Figure 5a), but minimal acute or subacuteinflammatory changes were evident. H&E stainingof brain tissue one month following implantationwith the large microchip (Figure 5d) showed evi-dence of a tract formation with surrounding gliosisand focal cystic cavitation, consistent with infarctedtissue. At the base of the tract, there was significantreactive gliosis and possible fibroblast proliferationbut very few acute or subacute inflammatorychanges. Trichrome staining at one month afterimplantation of the large chip demonstrated noevidence of significant collagen deposition to sug-gest increased fibrosis of the cellular proliferation atthe base of the tract (data not shown). However,glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) staining indi-cated reactive gliosis, and scattered CD-3 positiveT-lymphocytes were observed (Figure 5g,i). In addi-tion, CD68-positive macrophages and monocyteswere observed within this area (Figure 5h).Remnants of tract pathway with no other significantchanges were observed in controls.Figure 5.

DiscussionThe use of BCI technologies as novel tools to helpmanage neurological disease is a rapidly developingarea of interest. To fully realize the potential of thesetechnologies, progression from brain surface electro-des to subcortically implanted devices is essential.This observational proof-of-concept study sought toevaluate the use of a modified NICO BrainPath,a minimally invasive neurosurgical device, toimplant a microchip deep into rat brain. To ourknowledge, this is the first attempt to insert a BCIwithin the subcortical brain regions of a livinganimal.The BrainPath device enabled safe implantation ofmicrochips into the rat subcortical parenchyma. Allanimals survived the surgery and tolerated the proce-dure well, healing without infection and exhibiting typi-cal behavior without observable neurological deficitsuntil the study endpoints. Both small and large micro-chips were visible with the naked eye in formalin-fixedwhole brain sections (Figure 4b), confirming thatmicrochips were fully implanted and remained in situuntil the study endpoints. While the implantation coor-dinates used corresponded to the secondary motor (M2)cortex, the placement of the large microchip, in parti-cular, is likely to have spanned multiple regions, includ-ing the primary motor (M1) cortex and anteriorcingulate cortices (Cg1 and Cg2) [23]. Despite this, noanimal displayed any evidence of motor impairments,such as paresis.The effects of the implantation surgery on braintissue was further examined by immunohistochemistry(IHC) and histological analysis. Histological stainingwith H&E revealed the remnants of a tract at one-month post-implantation surgery (Figure 5a).Hemosiderin-laden macrophages surrounded the tractone month after small chip implantation (Figure 5b,c),indicating a phagocytic response to erythrocyte extra-vasation following neural injury with associated hemor-rhage. Gliosis with focal cystic cavitation was evidentone month after implantation with the large chip(Figure 5d,f), suggesting previously infarcted tissue,which may be due to the greater size of the large chip.Very few continuing acute or subacute inflammatorychanges were observed at either time point. Whilea more extensive fibroblastic proliferation responsewas evident one-month after implantation of the largechip, there was little evidence of significant collagendeposition to suggest increased fibrosis at the base ofthe tract, where the microchip had been placed. IHCexamination with anti-GFAP antibodies indicated reac-tive gliosis and scattered CD-3 positive T-lymphocyteswere observed that morphologically resembled macro-phages and monocytes (Figure 5g,i).The initiating event in any adverse tissue responsewas likely the insertion of the BrainPath device throughthe dura and into the parenchyma. Physical trauma toneural cells, the extracellular matrix, and the blood-brain barrier (BBB) are inevitable [11]; however, use ofthe BrainPath device was expected to limit this traumaas it uses a parafascicular, fiber-sparing approach.Histological staining revealed that implantation wasassociated with a degree of tissue damage, tract forma-tion, and surrounding reactive changes. Gliosis andhemosiderin-laden macrophages were evident sur-rounding tract marks at one-month post-implantation,while focal cystic cavitation consistent with infarctedtissue was evident three months after implantation.These responses do not necessarily indicate that theBrainPath device was ineffective at reducing tissue dis-ruption but rather suggest that the lissencephalic natureof the rat brain may have prevented an optimal trans-sulcal approach, thereby exacerbating the histologicalresponse to insertion.For this proof-of-concept study with a passiveimplant and short timeline, microchip material selec-tion was not critical. However, research increasinglysuggests that structural design and material composi-tion of active implantable devices may playa fundamental role in their long-term biostability andbiocompatibility [13,24]. The use of flexible materialsfor BCI devices has been recognized as a critical factorthat may reduce disruption of the BBB and surroundingtissue and subsequent gliosis [19,25]. BBB damage isstrongly associated with the initiation of biochemicalpathways involved in glial cell activation and neuronaldegeneration [26]. Flexible materials are considered tooffer shock absorption and vibration-dampening prop-erties [27]. Sucrose has been employed as a novel mate-rial to manufacture flexible [28] and dissolvable [29]implantation devices that can limit tissue injury oninsertion and minimize the response to foreign material.Microchips made from flexible carbon-based microfibermaterials such as carbon nanotubes and graphene havebeen proposed as alternatives to metal- and silicon-based construction [8,30]. Their smaller footprint mayreduce the forces exerted both during insertion andwhile the device is in situ [27], which may offer advan-tages of reduced tissue response – improving neuronalsurvival and reducing glial cell activation surroundingthe implantation site [24,31] – and provide higher pre-cision in neural stimulation and recording [24].Carbon-fiber construction, in particular, has beenshown to reduce tissue response to implantation ofa foreign body and improve signal resolution comparedBRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACES 7to metal-based implants [8,24]. However, other studieshave suggested that bioactive molecules, which manip-ulate the biological response to implanted materials,may offer greater success in reducing the foreign bodyresponse and glial-scar formation [11]. Examples of thisstrategy include the coating of implantable device mate-rials such as nanoscale laminin [32], neural adhesionmolecule L1 [33], and more recently, an astrocyte-derived extracellular matrix, which reduced astrogliosisin the rat cortex following chronic microelectrodeimplantation [34].Limitations of the study include the relatively shorttime – one or three months – that the microchips werein place. It is possible that more extensive tissueresponses may be observed if the microchip remainsin contact with brain tissue for longer. It is also possi-ble that some of the observed tissue responses mayresolve over a longer time frame. We were unable toevaluate implantation of the large microchip for thelonger interval of three months due to pandemic-related restrictions. Finally, although no effects onanimal well-being or neurological health wereobserved after implantation surgery, comprehensivemotor, cognitive, or behavioral assessments that mayreveal more subtle effects were beyond the scope of thisproof-of-concept study.5. ConclusionThe complexities of implanting BCIs pose several chal-lenges including access, tolerability, and foreign bodyresponse. This study sought to examine the feasibilityof repurposing an established, widely used neurosurgi-cal tool, the BrainPath, as a novel means to provideaccess for delivery of a BCI into subcortical brainregions. The brain’s response to the presence of foreignmaterials is of utmost concern, and methods to mod-ulate this have been the focus of much research overrecent years. Some of these strategies have been dis-cussed above, including designing flexible and biocom-patible devices for implantation and developing novelsurgical techniques to reduce tissue damage. Thisexploratory study used passive microchips; however,establishing the feasibility of this approach will enablefuture studies using active microchips, evaluation ofnew biocompatible materials, and motor and cognitivetesting to observe outcomes and tolerability over moreextended survival periods.AbbreviationsAP anterior-posteriorBBB blood-brain barrierBCI brain computer interfaceCR clinical record scoreDV dorsal-ventralGFAP glial fibrillary acidic proteinICs integrated circuitsIHC immunohistochemistryML medial-lateralAcknowledgementsThe authors thank Dr. John Rogers and Dr. Jan-KaiChang at Northwestern University for their assistancewith the production and provision of microchips.
